## [ECON2001](http://www.pitt.edu/~luca/ECON2001/) - Introduction to Mathematical Methods
Pitt economics summer math camp

Instructor:
Luca Rigotti, 4905 Posvar Hall, luca at pitt dot edu
Office hours: by appointment.

- 대략 읽어보니, 집합론, 해석학, 선형대수학, 미적분학, 미분방정식 등 기초 수학 지식들을 경영에서 필요한 내용만 발췌한 내용들.
- 복습하기에 딱 좋은 자료.
- 거기다 12장부터는 최적화 기초도 존재.
- 13장엔 실해석 measure theory도 있네;; 와후
